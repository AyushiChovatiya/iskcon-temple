                <p class="poli-sm-secp">Undesignated Gifts</p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Undesignated gifts are those gifts given without stipulation by donor. These gifts
                    comprise the majority of the Temple’s total receipts. They are relied upon to fund the
                    budget/services and programs of the Temple.
                </p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Designated Gifts</p>
                <p class="poli-secp">The Temple will accept designated gifts if they are specified for a pre-approved
                    project, ministry or program administered by the Temple. All other contributions will go to the
                    Temple’s general fund and be utilized per the discretion of its President, Board and other
                    designated authorities.
                </p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Receipt of Benefit by Donor</p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Any benefit or premium received by a donor in exchange for a contribution reduces
                    the amount of the deduction of the contribution. In the event of such a contribution where a benefit
                    was received, the Temple will inform the donor of the estimated value of the goods or services
                    received by the donor. If the amount of the contribution exceeds the value of the benefit received,
                    the donor may deduct the amount over the value of the benefit as a charitable contribution.
                </p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Non-Cash Gifts</p>
                <p class="poli-secp">The Temple will accept most types of non-cash gifts, provided the gift is
                    determined to be related to the purpose of the Temple and in the Temple’s best interest. All
                    non-cash gifts will be reviewed and approved by the Temple. The Temple will acknowledge receipt of
                    the gift by letter. The letter will provide a brief description of the item donated. The Temple is
                    not responsible for appraisals and will not determine the fair value of donated property. The
                    estimated fair value of the gift will not be reflected on the letter or the donor’s record of
                    contribution. It is the donor’s responsibility to determine the fair market value of the gift.
                </p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Donations of Stock</p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Whereas neither the members of the Temple’s board of directors nor its staff are
                    professional investment portfolio managers, it is the policy of this organization to liquidate stock
                    immediately upon receipt. The possible transaction cost of this sale is considered small compared to
                    the risk of loss that can be experienced with delay in the sale of the stock. Donors should be aware
                    of this policy so that they are not surprised by the immediate liquidation of the gift.

                    determine to accept the use of property in such cases where the donor understands no deduction from
                    the contribution is allowed.
                </p>
                <p class="poli-secp">Gifts to Individuals</p>

                    record of contributions.

                    in accordance with rules and regulations required by the IRS. Non-cash gifts will be acknowledged by
                    letter as described above in compliance with IRS rules and regulations.
                </p>
                <p class="poli-p">Returns of Contribution</p>
                <p class="poli-secp">It is the Temple’s policy that gifts made in good faith will not be returned.
                    However, we understand circumstances arise; if a return is requested in writing within 7 days of
                    making a qualifying contribution, the ISKCON Board will review the request and make a determination.
                    The written request should detail any special circumstances that merit the return of the good faith
                    contribution.

                <p class="poli-secp">Year of Contribution</p>

                    of contribution. If mailed, the gift must reflect a postmark no later than March 31.
                </p>
                <p class="poli-secp">The Temple respects the donor’s decision to give as inspired by the Lord. The above
                    policies are meant to provide guidance to the donor and the Temple body as well as comply with tax
                    laws. The Temple reserves the right to refuse contributions that are not related to the primary
                    purpose of the Temple, not in the best interest of the Temple, or those not qualified for tax
                    purposes.
