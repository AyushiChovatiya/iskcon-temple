            <p>For millennia the teachings and the rich culture of bhakti-yoga, or Krishna Consciousness, had been
                hidden
                within the borders of India. Today, millions around the globe express their gratitude to Srila
                Prabhupada
                for revealing the timeless wisdom of bhakti to a world. Born as Abhay Charan De on September 1, 1896, in
                Calcutta, as a young man he joined Mahatma Gandhi's civil disobedience movement. In 1922, a meeting with
                the
                prominent scholar and spiritual leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, proved to be most influential
                on
                young Abhay's future calling…</p>
            <p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava community, a monotheistic tradition within
                the broader Hindu culture. At their very first meeting, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta asked Abhay to bring the
                teachings of Lord Krishna to the English-speaking world. Deeply moved by his devotion and wisdom, Abhay
                became a disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, and resolved to carry out his mentor’s request.
                Abhay, later known by the honorific A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, spent the next 32 years
                preparing for his journey west. <a href="#">Read More</a>

                <h2>About HH Mahavishnu Goswami Maharaj</h2>
                <p>His Holiness Srila Mahavishnu Goswami Maharaj was born in the outskirts of Mumbai in 1919 on the
                    auspicious day of Dattātreya Purnima in the month of mārga-śīrṣa [November-December]. He appeared in
                    an
                    eight generation Vaishnava family. At the tender age, he began studying the holy scriptures of
                    Srimad
                    Bhagavat-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam in earnest. He is highly educated having obtained a masters
                    degree
                    in both Sanskrit and English and is equally conversant in Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu and the
                    Gujarati dialect Kachhi. His burning desire to realize God was finally answered, when he met Srila
                    Prabhupada, the founder acharya of the International Society of Krsna Consciousness (ISKCON).
                    Maharaj
                    first took darshan of Srila Prabhupāda in 1973 when, as President of the London Gujarati Community
                    Society, he invited Prabhupäda to be guest-of-honour at the society’s annual function. There Srila
                    Prabhupada’s lecture marked the turning point in Maharaj’s life. Srila Prabhupāda had stated that
                    whenever we meet our friends, we ask them so many material things, like how is your business, your
                    family etc. But this is simply a waste of time. If we really cared for them, then when we meet them,
                    we
                    should ask them how far they have progressed, since we last met, in the matter of stopping the
                    repetition of the cycle of birth and death. Since that profound meeting, H H Mahāvishnu Goswami
                    Maharaj
                    has dedicated his life to the rigorous study of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. <a href="#">Read More</a>
