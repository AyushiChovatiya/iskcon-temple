                <h4 class="who-title">Who is Srila Prabhupada?</h4>
                <p class="who-p">For millennia the teachings and the rich culture of bhakti-yoga, or Krishna
                    Consciousness, had been hidden within the borders of India. Today, millions around the globe express
                    their gratitude to Srila Prabhupada for revealing the timeless wisdom of bhakti to a world.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">Born as Abhay Charan De on September 1, 1896, in Calcutta, as a young man he joined
                    Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience movement. In 1922, a meeting with the prominent scholar and
                    spiritual leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, proved to be most influential on young Abhay’s
                    future calling.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava community, a monotheistic
                    tradition within the broader Hindu culture. At their very first meeting, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta asked
                    Abhay to bring the teachings of Lord Krishna to the English-speaking world. Deeply moved by his
                    devotion and wisdom, Abhay became a disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, and resolved to carry
                    out his mentor’s request. Abhay, later known by the honorific A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,
                    spent the next 32 years preparing for his journey west.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">In 1965, at the age of sixty-nine, Srila Prabhupada begged a free passage and boarded a
                    cargo ship, the Jaladhuta, to New York. The journey proved to be treacherous and he suffered two
                    heart attacks aboard. After 35 days at sea, he first arrived at a lonely Brooklyn pier with just
                    seven dollars in Indian rupees and a crate of his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">In New York, he faced great hardships and began his mission humbly by giving classes on
                    the Bhagavad-gita in lofts on the Bowery and leading kirtan (traditional devotional chants) in
                    Tompkins Square Park. His message of peace and goodwill resonated with many young people, some of
                    whom came forward to become serious students of the Krishna-bhakti tradition. With the help of these
                    students, Bhaktivedanta Swami rented a small storefront on New York’s Lower East Side to use as a
                    temple.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">In July of 1966, Bhaktivedanta Swami established the International Society for Krishna
                    Consciousness (ISKCON) for the purpose he stated of “checking the imbalance of values in the world
                    and working for real unity and peace”.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">In the eleven years that followed, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe 14 times on
                    lecture tours spreading the teachings of Lord Krishna. Men and women from all backgrounds and walks
                    of life came forward to accept his message. With their help, Srila Prabhupada established temples,
                    farm communities, a publishing house, and educational institutions around the world. And, he began
                    what has now become the world’s largest vegetarian food relief program, Hare Krishna Food for Life.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">With the desire to nourish the roots of Krishna consciousness in its home, Srila
                    Prabhupada returned to India several times, where he sparked a revival in the Vaishnava tradition.
                    In India, he opened dozens of temples, including large centers in the holy towns of Vrindavana and
                    Mayapura.
                </p>
                <p class="who-p">Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contributions, perhaps, are his books. He authored
                    over 70 volumes on the Krishna tradition, which are highly respected by scholars for their
                    authority, depth, fidelity to the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works are used as textbooks
                    in numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into 76 languages. His most prominent
                    works include: Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the 30-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the 17-volume Sri
                    Caitanya-caritamrita.
                    A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada passed away on November 14, 1977, in the holy town of
                    Vrindavana, surrounded by his loving disciples who carry on his mission today.
