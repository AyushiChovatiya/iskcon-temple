                <p class="sun-title">Sunday Program</p>
                <p class="sun-p">Srila Prabhupad, the Founder Acharya of International Society for Krishna consciousness
                    (ISKCON) had always been encouraging us to distribute food (Krishna Prasad) free for all.
                </p>
                <p class="sun-p">And to following the instructions we at ISKCON Rajkot organize “Sunday Love Feast” on
                    every Sunday.
                </p>
                <p class="sun-p">This is our unique food distribution program which satisfies the body by providing
                    first class vegetarian meals to everyone.
                </p>
                <p class="sun-p">And it simultaneously satisfies the soul because the food is prepared by temple
                    devotees and offered to Lord Shri Krishna before it is distributed.
                </p>
                <p class="sun-p">Thus it becomes Krishna Prasad.</p>
                <p class="sun-p">And not only that we are also distributing Hari Naam to everyone with devotion.So come
                    and join us to chant the Holy Names of the Lord, take Krishna Prasad & understand the philosophy of
                    Vedic scriptures given by Lord Shri Krishna.
                </p>
                <p class="sun-p">We love to invite you all.</p>
                <p class="sun-p">Come & be a part of the “Sunday Love Feast”.</p>
