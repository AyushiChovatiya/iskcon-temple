                    Seven Mothers
                    Gopal Gaushala, an initiative of ISKCON Rajkot, supports more than 50 cows by providing fodder,
                    shelter and medical care for them daily. Gau means cow and dan means donation – Gau-dan is
                    considered one of the most powerful and pure donation since it frees one from sinful reactions and
                    helps one attain residence in the spiritual world. We care for 50 cows daily in our Gaushala and now
                    its your turn to help us care for cows.
