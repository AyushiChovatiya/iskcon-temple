                <h2 class="what-title">What is ISKCON?</h2>
                <!-- <p class="what-p"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN5-LSgvuEg"></a></p> -->
                <p class="what-p">The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), otherwise known as the
                    Hare Krishna
                    movement, includes five hundred major centers, temples and rural communities, nearly one hundred
                    affilated vegetarian restaurants, thousands of&nbsp;<em>namahattas&nbsp;</em>or local meeting
                    groups, a wide variety of community projects, and millions of congregational members worldwide.
                    Although less than fifty years on the global stage, ISKCON has expanded widely since its founding by
                    His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in New York City in 1966.
                </p>
                <p class="what-p">ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradāya, a monotheistic tradition within
                    the Vedic or
                    Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-gītā and the Bhagavat
                    Purana, or Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition,
                    which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for God, or
                    Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”.
                </p>
                <p class="what-p">God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama,
                    etc. ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the maha-mantra, or the great prayer for
                    deliverance: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama,
                    Hare Hare.
                </p>
                <p class="what-p">Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of
                    Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as “a
                    tradition that commands a respected place in the religious life of humankind.” In the 1980s Dr. A.
                    L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that, “It
                    arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years and has become known all over the West. This,
                    I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the Western world.”
                </p>
                <p class="what-p">ISKCON’s founder, Srila Prabhupada, has drawn appreciation from scholars and religious
                    leaders alike for his remarkable achievement in presenting India’s Vaishnava spiritual culture in a
                    relevant manner to contemporary Western and worldwide audiences.
                </p>
                <p class="what-p">Members of ISKCON practice bhakti-yoga in their homes and also worship in temples.
                    They also promote bhakti-yoga, or Krishna Consciousness, through festivals, the performing arts,
                    yoga seminars, public chanting, and the distribution of the society’s literatures. ISKCON members
                    have also opened hospitals, schools, colleges, eco-villages, free food distribution projects, and
                    other institutions as a practical application of the path of devotional yoga.
